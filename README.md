## How to Use BSV Agents in Claude Code

After installation, the BSV agents become available as specialized assistants in Claude Code. Here's how to use them effectively:

### Invoking BSV Agents

#### Automatic Agent Selection
Claude Code will often automatically suggest the most appropriate BSV agent based on your task description. For example:
- "Help me build a BSV transaction" → Suggests `bsv-blockchain-ts-sdk-expert`
- "I need to implement wallet functionality" → Suggests `bsv-blockchain-wallet-toolbox-expert`
- "Create an identity certificate system" → Suggests `bsv-blockchain-identity-services-expert`

#### Manual Agent Invocation
You can explicitly invoke an agent using the Task tool in Claude Code. Simply describe your task and Claude will route it to the appropriate agent:

```
User: "I need to create a P2PKH transaction with the BSV SDK"
Claude: [Uses Task tool with bsv-blockchain-ts-sdk-expert]
```

### When to Use Each Agent

#### BSV Blockchain TypeScript SDK Expert
**Best for:**
- Low-level blockchain interactions using `@bsv/sdk`
- Custom script logic and OP_RETURN data
- SPV verification and merkle proofs
- BRC standards implementation (BRC-42, BRC-29, BRC-62, BRC-78, BRC-95)
- BEEF format and transaction broadcasting via ARC
- Distributed storage with SHIP protocol
- Advanced cryptographic operations (threshold signatures, secret sharing)
- Wallet integration with substrate patterns
- Overlay networks and identity management
- Enterprise-scale blockchain solutions

**Example scenarios:**
```
"Generate TypeScript code to create a P2PKH transaction sending 10,000 satoshis"
"How do I embed data in a transaction using OP_RETURN?"
"Implement SPV verification for a transaction using MerklePath"
"Show me BRC-42 key derivation for a specific protocol ID"

**Example scenarios:**
```
"Set up a BSV wallet for a web app with IndexedDB storage"

- Topic Manager implementation with robust validation logic
- Lookup Service patterns with advanced database optimization
- PushDrop encoding for secure on-chain storage
- Privacy-enhanced identity with field encryption
- Comprehensive testing strategies for identity systems
- Deployment automation and production monitoring
- Enterprise identity management at scale

**Example scenarios:**
```
"Design a BRC-64/65 compliant identity certificate schema"
"Implement a TopicManager for validating identity certificates"
"Query identity records in a LookupService using MongoDB"
"Encode a VerifiableCertificate on-chain using PushDrop"
"Build a production-scale overlay network for identity verification"
"Implement comprehensive testing for identity certificate validation"
"Set up deployment automation for identity services"
"Optimize database queries for large-scale identity lookups"
"Create enterprise identity management with monitoring and alerts"
```

### Working with Multiple Agents

For complex BSV projects, you'll often need to combine expertise from multiple agents:

#### Identity-Enabled Wallet
Combine `identity-services` and `wallet-toolbox` agents:
1. Use identity agent to design BRC-64/65 certificates
2. Use wallet agent to integrate identity storage and signing

#### Custom Transaction in a Wallet
Combine `ts-sdk` and `wallet-toolbox` agents:
1. Use wallet agent for UTXO selection and key management
2. Use SDK agent for custom script creation and transaction building

#### Full dApp Development
Use all three agents together:
1. Identity agent for user authentication layer
2. Wallet agent for fund management
3. SDK agent for custom smart contracts and protocols

#### Enterprise-Scale Production Deployment
Combine all agents for production-ready systems:
1. **SDK agent** for advanced cryptographic operations, threshold signatures, and enterprise blockchain infrastructure
2. **Identity agent** for production-scale overlay networks, comprehensive testing, and deployment automation
3. **Wallet agent** for enterprise wallet management with monitoring and error handling

#### High-Throughput Transaction Processing
Leverage advanced capabilities across agents:
1. **SDK agent** for atomic BEEF transactions, batch processing, and enterprise broadcasting
2. **Wallet agent** for optimized UTXO management and concurrent transaction handling
3. **Identity agent** for certificate validation at scale and database optimization

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed requirements and context for better results
2. **Include Code Context**: Share existing code snippets or architecture decisions
3. **Iterate and Refine**: Use agent outputs as starting points and request modifications
4. **Choose the Right Agent**: Match the agent to your specific task domain
5. **Combine Strategically**: Break complex tasks into sub-problems for each agent

#### Enterprise Development Considerations

6. **Production Readiness**: Leverage agents' production-scale features for enterprise deployments
7. **Testing Strategy**: Use identity agent's comprehensive testing capabilities for robust validation
8. **Deployment Automation**: Implement deployment automation patterns for consistent releases
9. **Performance Optimization**: Apply database optimization and scaling patterns for high-throughput systems
10. **Security Best Practices**: Implement threshold signatures and advanced cryptographic operations for enterprise security
11. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Build production monitoring into identity and wallet systems
12. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling patterns across all agent integrations

## How It Works

1. **Clones Repository**: Downloads the latest BSV agents from GitHub
2. **Creates Symlinks**: Links agent files to your `~/.claude/agents/` directory  
3. **Preserves Updates**: Maintains connection to source repository for easy updates
4. **Clean Management**: Handles existing files and provides clean installation

The agents are installed as symlinks from `~/.claude/bsv-claude-agents/agents/` to `~/.claude/agents/`, allowing for easy updates and management.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **Git**: Required for cloning the agents repository
- **Claude Code**: The agents are designed for use with Claude Code

### Windows Users
The package is fully compatible with Windows! The CLI automatically detects your operating system and uses the appropriate linking method:
- **Windows**: Uses hard links (no administrator privileges required)
- **macOS/Linux**: Uses symbolic links (standard approach)

If you encounter permission issues on Windows, you can:
- Enable Developer Mode in Windows Settings → Update & Security → For developers
- Or run the command as administrator (not recommended for regular use)

## Update Agents

To update your BSV agents to the latest version, simply run the installation command again:

```bash
// If not installed in project
npx @bsv/bsv-claude-agents
// If installed in project
npx bsv-claude-agents
```

This will pull the latest changes and update your local agent files.

## Development

For local development and testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/bsv-claude-agents.git
cd bsv-claude-agents
node bin/cli.js --local
```

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues
If you encounter linking errors on Windows:
1. **Try Developer Mode**: Enable Developer Mode in Windows Settings
2. **Check File System**: Ensure you're using NTFS (required for hard links)
3. **Fallback Mode**: The CLI automatically falls back to file copying if linking fails

### General Issues
- **Git not found**: Ensure Git is installed and available in your PATH
- **Permission errors**: Check that you have write access to `~/.claude/` directory
- **Node.js version**: Verify you're using Node.js 14 or higher
